# Dart Server Project 🚀

A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code in `lib/`, and example unit tests in `test/`.

---

## Getting Started 🎉

This project demonstrates how to build and run a Dart server application from the command-line. The project is structured as follows:

- **bin/**: Contains the main entrypoint of the application.
- **lib/**: Holds the library code.
- **test/**: Contains unit tests to ensure your code works as expected.

## Running the Dart Server 🖥️

Follow these steps to launch the Dart server:

1. **Install Dart SDK**  
   Make sure you have the Dart SDK installed. Verify by running:
   ```bash
   dart --version
   ```
   If Dart is not installed, follow the instructions on the [Dart website](https://dart.dev/get-dart) to install it.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Open your terminal and navigate to the project's root directory:
   ```bash
   cd server/
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Retrieve all necessary packages by running:
   ```bash
   dart pub get
   ```

4. **Run the Server**  
   Start the server by executing:
   ```bash
   dart run
   ```
   This command runs the entrypoint located in the `bin/` directory. The server should now be up and running!

5. **Accessing the Server**  
   If your server listens on a specific port (e.g., `8080`), you can access it via your browser or API client at:
   ```http
   http://localhost:8080
   ```
   *Note: The port number may vary based on your configuration.*

## Running Tests ✅

To ensure everything is working correctly, run the unit tests with:
```bash
dart test
```

## Troubleshooting ❗

- **Dependency Issues:**  
  If you encounter issues, make sure all dependencies are installed and up-to-date:
  ```bash
  dart pub get
  ```
  
- **Dart Version:**  
  Check your Dart version to ensure compatibility. Update if necessary.
